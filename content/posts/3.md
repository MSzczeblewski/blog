A great thing about being interested in technology for years is the plethora of extra parts lying around. Gather up all the stuff acumilating for years and now we have a server!

## Specs 
- Intel i7 3770k
- 16GB DDR3
- 1.25 TB SSD
- 5 TB HDD
- Quad Port 1GB Cisco NIC (Intel I350)

### Goal
One of the main goals is to virtualize a router and run the Home Lab behind it so networking experiments can be conducted without affecting anyone else in the house.
As things progress the plan is to fully integrate the networks using vlans to seperate traffic. 

### Current
- Proxmox is running as the hypervisor
- Pfsense has been installed 
- Homelab is currently running behind pfsense router

### Future
- Pfsense to setup proper firewall rules
- Samba server in LXC container for NFS
- Docker and messing around with some projects
